## Introduction

When you took the sophomore course in organic chemistry, you studied the typical reactions of halooalkanes, alkenes/alkynes, aromatic compounds and organic carbonyl compounds, etc. The goal of that cours was to introduce you to compound classes and how reactions occur. However, the course did not focus how to design a synthetic route to prepare a given organic compound from readily available starting materials. This is a crucial aspect of organic chemistry. The design and synthesis of novel organic compounds is fundamental to the development of new medicines, agrochemicals, plastics, dyestuffs, etc. 

This class will be hard work. Part of doing chemistry is productive failure: You’ll try things that don’t work; learn something from that failure; and try something new that works a bit better. After a while, you will figure it out, and come out with a much stronger understanding of what organic chemistry is, and why we insist on teaching it to future health professionals.

Topics covered in this course include retrosynthetic analysis (RSA), functional group interconversions, selectivity in synthesis, construction of rings, prediction and control of stereochemistry, cross-coupling reactions, two-direactional synthesis, catalysis, green chemistry and economy of synthesis.

### Course materials and technology

- **Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and information is our Canvas site, accessible through [INSERT LINK](https://). The Canvas site will house assignments, grades, and links to materials/resources.
- **Zoom:** Virtual meetings (if any) will be held via Zoom. Links and passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas.
- **Document scanning tool**: Many assignments in this course are designed to be prepared by hand on paper. Few people own document scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can do a sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.
- **Personal computer:** You will need a x86 class personal computer that can run standalone desktop applications. Mobile devices can be used but they are inferior or incompatible with software we will use.
- **ChemDraw** is available for registered Fresno State students. You will use ChemDraw to type revised solutions to homework problems. 

### Assumed prior knowledge and skills

This course is a continuation of sophomore organic chemistry course (CHEM 128 series at Fresno State). I am assuming that you come to this course already familiar with concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128 and you are able to:

- draw valid structures of organic molecules
- use curved arrow notation to depict reaction mechanisms
- analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and reactivity of organic molecules; and

## Course-level learning objectives

This course is a study of organic chemistry in the context of multi-step synthesis of complex small molecules (<1000 Da). After successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

1. Communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using drawing and naming notation and using effective oral communication.
2. Weigh the issues of chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity in synthetic design by identifying steric, electronic, and stereoelectronic effects that influence selectivity. 
3. Navigate the landscape of organic reactions by proposing examples and non-examples of syntheses, and drawing conclusions from reaction mechanisms. 
4. Demonstrate organic synthesis skills through planning, execution, troubleshooting of multi-step synthetic sequences. Identify flaws in synthetic plans by recognizing selectivity or efficiency issues. 
5. Read and follow research articles on total syntheses of natural products and identify strategies and tactics that allow chemists to construct complex molecules.

These are the overarching university goals for this class. We will break these down into more specific objectives throughout the semester. In addition to everything above, we will focus on some important objectives that go beyond this class. Specifically, I want you to...

- Succeed! Specifically, I want you to develop a deep understanding of the ideas outlined above. You can expect me to push you in many ways to help you achieve these. As a result, this class will not be easy, but that’s good: You learn by struggling!
- Learn to write and present in a manner that further improves your scientific communication skills. We will work on this in almost every aspect of class. Particularly important are your homework, portfolio, and the class journal, which will be written to a professional standard, as well as in-class presentations. 
- Learn chemistry from a new point of view. This includes a deep knowledge of reactions and their mechanisms. It also involves learning the why of the historical and modern development of organic synthesis, and deeply understanding the importance of this field in biology, material science, and medicine. 

## Course workflow

This class will be **face to face**. If Fresno State moves to a remote format at any point, or if the instructor or a substantial number of students are absent due to quarantine or isolation, we will continue to hold class at the regular time in synchronous format via Zoom. Watch Canvas and your Fresno State email for details and links.

The goal of this course is not to cover all strategies and tactics used in organic synthesis but to provide opportunities for development of a skill which you need as a graduate student: to quickly learn complex and unfamiliar science topics to the degree that you can teach them to others. Therefore, active participation in class discussions is key to getting the most out of this class. Expect to be at the board on a weekly basis to discuss synthetic and mechanistic problems. Don't be concerned if you feel weak in some areas. The goal is to identify those areas to strengthen your understanding and refine thinking process. This means that it is of utter importance that you come to class prepared.

:::info
Our class meetings are in the afternoon when energy levels can be low and attention muscles depleted. To reduce the risk of falling asleep, there will be little to no lecturing. Instead, this course is going to be ran according to the flipped learning model, an instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities (reading assignments, lecture videos, etc.). Class time is repurposed for collaborative work and practice. This [video series](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250) highlights the basics of flipped learning.
:::

Here’s what you will do at each point during the week. All times are Fresno, CA time (Pacific).

1. **Monday Class Prep (1--2 hours)**: Find and work on the Class Prep assignment for the upcoming Monday class (posted no later than Friday before). Scan and upload your work and volunteer to present. 

	- Work on it: Friday–Monday
	- Submit by: Monday 1 pm on Canvas
	
2. **Wednesday Class Prep (1--2 hours)**: Find and work on the Class Prep assignment for the upcoming Wednesday class (posted no later than Monday). Scan and upload your work and volunteer to present. 

	- Work on it: Monday--Wednesday
	- Submit by: Wednesday 1 pm on Canvas
	
3. **Complete weekly homework and revisions (3 -- 4 hours)**. Work on homework problems throughout the week, and submit a revision of a previous homework problem.

	- Work on it: Throughout the week
	- Submit by: Friday 5 pm on Canvas

:::info
**A word about due dates**[^1]

Here is how due dates work in the workplace: They exist, and they’re important. However, there’s a certain amount of flexibility with them. If you need a little longer on something, you email whoever set the deadline and ask if you can have some more time. This is usually not a big deal, but if it happens a lot, people will start asking you if everything is alright.

That is also how due dates work in this class. Email me to ask for an extension on anything you need, and that’s mostly fine. It helps if you propose a concrete new deadline (e.g. “I can get this to you by tomorrow at midnight…”). If you ask for lots of extensions, we’ll work together to find ways to help you keep up. Note that you may not get timely feedback if you need an extension on something.

If you have significant extenuating circumstances that cause you to miss multiple assignments, please come to an office hour to discuss broader accommodations. I’ll be flexible, but it helps to know what you need so that I can find the best way to help.
One important limit: Class Preps are due before class so that you’re primed and ready to think about others’ ideas, and so that I can choose presenters. For that reason, Class Preps absolutely must be done before class. If you need a little more time than the standard deadline let me know.

## Learning activities and assessments

::info
**The Life of a Problem** Most of this class will center around interesting and deep problems. You will first encounter a problem in *Class Prep*. Before class, you will spend time attempting to solve this problem. You and classmates will help us come to a common understanding of these questions through your *in-class presentations* and discussion. You will write up final solutions in *homework*, and may eventually revise and improve them. They will eventually become *portfolio problems* to showcase your progress. When you are especially proud of your work, you can submit it to the *class journal* too.
Expect to spend a lot of time on each problem!
:::

- Class Preparation and Research Notebook (scan and upload to Canvas by 1 pm before each class): Before each class, you will attempt new problems, make notes in a research notebook, and volunteer to present them in class.
- Presentations and Class Journal (daily in class): I will ask you to share your work with the class. There are two ways to do this: Presenting in class, and publishing your work in the Class Journal.
- Homework (submit on Canvas every Wednesday by 11:59 pm): This is the biggest regular assignment in this class. You will write professional solutions to a subset of Class Prep problems, based on your prep work, class presentations, and discussions.
- Check-ins (two times, roughly in weeks 5 and 10): Twice this semester, I will ask you to reflect on your progress and compare it to the criteria for grades in our course. To do this, you will write a reflection about your work in the class, your understanding, and your goals for the rest of class. The goal is to ensure that we both agree on where you are, and what you need to do to succeed in class. Details will be given in class and posted on Canvas.
- Portfolio (submit on Canvas at end of final exam): Your final exam in this class is to submit your portfolio: A collection of your work that showcases your development as a chemist and student of organic synthesis in this class.

All assignments will be submitted on Canvas. I will give you feedback via Canvas or your Fresno State email.

## How to earn a grade in this course

:::warning
Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please read this section carefully and ask questions as needed. 
:::

As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that *learning takes time* and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve *multiple attempts* that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe your work should be evaluated by just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you *clearly defined standards* for quality, *detailed feedback* on your work, and *opportunities to try again* based on the feedback. This gets you into a *feedback loop*, a conversation between you and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course students can *revise and resubmit some of their work*, several times over if needed, using the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.

:::success
The main goal for students in this course is to build a body of work, **a portfolio** of sorts, *that demonstrates understanding* of strategies and tactics in organic synthesis *as well as engagement* with the course. There is not exams to pass, points to earn, etc.
:::

### Ways to show understanding or organic synthesis

- **Write solutions to synthetic problems that meet objectives (after revision).**
- **Write several exemplary solutions throughout the semester and/or have several solutions accepted to the class journal.**
- **Demonstrate deep understanding of these topics: retrosynthetic analysis, chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity, green chemistry.**
- Use curved arrow electron-pushing formalism to explain reaction mechanisms and/or selectivity.
- Find and use connections between ideas and concepts (in problems, presentations, research articles, and other places).
- Share your ideas by giving presentations or writing class journal entries that clearly communicate your thinking process.
- When presenting, give helpful answers to questions.
- Give presenters helpful feedback through questions, suggestions, etc.
- Read others' class journal submissions and use them to improve your writing.

### Ways to show engagement with class

- **Complete assigned pre-class work with genuine good-faith effort. Work to make sense of new disconnections, reactions, and mechanisms (even if not fully correct). Try multiple approaches and include errors and comments on your thought process.**
- **Volunteer to present your work**
- **Volunteer to present published total synthesis**
- Actively participate in discussions (this could take many forms).
- Complete all work, in and out of class. Actively seek out resources to catch up if you miss class.
- Be a leader in your groups (there are different ways to demonstrate leadership).
- Be an active and engaged member of your groups and contribute meaningfully to all group work.
- Support classmates and help them succeed.

## Class Prep and Research Notebook

**Description and Purpose**. I will post a list of the current problems on which we are working. Your goal is to read and solve---or make as much progress as possible---on these problems before the next class. This will ensure that you are ready to take an active part in our class presentations and discussions. The research notebook is a place to keep and organize your notes on all of these problems. 

In short, I’m asking you to attempt big, real, difficult problems before class. *This is not easy!* But, it’s also as real as chemistry gets. You will learn what to do when you don’t know what to do; how to find and try multiple approaches; the benefits of collaborating in order to generate new ideas and understand old ones; and how past mistakes can help you improve in the future.

**Research notebook**. You will need a way to keep daily handwritten notes organized. I suggest a 3-ring binder or folder that is dedicated to this class, or the electronic equivalent (e.g. a note-taking app on a tablet). Keep all of your Class Prep work together, dated and ordered, so that it’s easy to find.

### What to do

- Look up the reading and problems in Canvas. Read the text carefully, for full understanding. If there are new reactions or mechanisms, create examples to help you understand them. 
- For each problem

	- Start each problem on a new page in your research notebook. Label with the full problem or theorem number and statement, and the date.
	-  Work to solve the problem or propose the synthesis. This is a rough draft, aim to fully understand the ideas, but you can write in a unstructured format that identifies the key steps and ideas. Formal communication is not required, but aim to be thorough.
	-  Keep your mistakes! This process of understanding and attempting to solve new problems will involve many dead ends. Never erase your mistakes: Just put an “X” next to any idea which seems to be wrong, and write a note to yourself about why you believe it is wrong. These ideas will often be useful in the future.

- You are *strongly encouraged to collaborate on Class Prep*. Give specific credit next to ideas and key insights. See “Academic Integrity” for details.
- Class Prep work should take quite a while: Up to 50% of your out-of-class time should be devoted to working on these new problems. That is 1 - 2 full hours for each hour in class. Start at least 24 hours early.
- Scan and upload your Class Prep work to Canvas by 1 pm on class day. In the “Comments” text box, indicate which problems (if any) you would be willing to present in class. See Presentations and the Class Journal for details.

:::success
Think of Class Prep as a completion and effort assignment. Make a genuine effort to understand and thoroughly solve the required problems -- but it’s OK if this work is wrong! The goal is to be prepared. Incorrect but well-thought-out answers are fine. I may occasionally ask to see your research notebook, to ensure it is complete and organized.
:::

## Presentations and the Class Journal

A central part of this class is sharing your ideas with classmates. You can do this by presenting in class or publishing in our class journal. Presentations and class journals are great ways to show your engagement with chemistry ideas and engagement with class as a whole. Be willing to go out on a limb and share your thoughts!

### Present in class

I will ask you to present your work on some of the Class Prep questions during class. Your ideas will start discussions. Your goal is to have a complete and correct solution, but it is the goal that matters, not the actual solution.

- **Volunteeering to present:** When you submit your Class Prep work (see Class Prep), indicate which problems you are willing to present in class. I will post a list of presenters at the start of class. If you volunteered, be ready to present! I will not select presenters based on correctness, rather, I will focus on those whose voices have been heard less (or less recently). I may ask multiple students to present, if their solutions are different or illustrate interesting issues. You won’t present every time you volunteer.
- **Is it correct?** The goal of a presentation is to communicate your understanding of an idea in a helpful way, and to create discussions that help everyone understand it better. Aim to be correct, but the goal is the important part, not actually being correct. Mistakes and the discussions following them are some of the most valuable ways for everyone to learn!

### Publish in the Class Journal

The Class Journal is a document where we will collaboratively create professionally written solutions to every problem we do. I will post a list of all problems that are open for Class Journal submissions.

- **Claiming problems:** You may “claim” an open problem by emailing me. I will add your name and the date on the list of problems. You then have 1 week to submit an excellent homework-quality solution. You may only have one problem claimed at a time.
Just like with presentations, if more than one person asks to claim a problem at the same time, I will choose based on who has completed fewer presentations and journals.
- **Review process:** I will review your submission and choose whether to accept it.  Journal problems must be fully correct and illustrate excellent communication. To achieve this, I might ask you to make revisions before accepting your work.
- **Being a reviewer:** If you’ve demonstrated excellent work in creating proofs, I may ask you to become a reviewer (taking over the role described in “Review process” above). This is an honor! It’s also a great way to demonstrate your deep understanding of geometric ideas.

## Homework

I will assign 1--3 homework problems every week. These are significant assignments that form the major part of your out-of-class work beyond class prep. Expect to spend at least half of your out-of-class time on homework. You should spend frequent, regular, and significant amounts of time on homework assignments.

- **What do I do?** Write correct, complete, convincing, and clear solutions (synthetic proposals) to some Class Prep problems. This should be based on your own Class Prep work and our class presentations and discussion. You will also sometimes write short essays on related topics.
- **Due date:** Homework is due each Friday at 5 pm on Canvas.
- **Template and typing:** Homeworks must be typed. I will post ChemDraw templates on Canvas.
- **Objectives and focus:** Read the Homework Objectives Page on Canvas. Your work should meet the objectives listed there. Each homework assignment will list some specific “focus” objectives. These will help you practice different aspects of communication throughout the semester.
- **Feedback and Progress:** Homework is one of the main ways to show how you’ve earned your desired grade. I will give you detailed feedback on each assignment to help you understand your progress. See the Homework Objectives document for details.
- **Collaboration:** Each homework set will have specific instructions about collaboration. You may always talk with Dr. Muchalski about problems. See “Academic Integrity” for more details.

### Revisions of homework assignments

You may revise your work on one homework problem each week. 

**On each revision, include a short reflection:** Summarize the important items that caused you to earn a lower mark than desired. Then explain what you did to improve your understanding (be specific!), and how you have demonstrated that in this revision. With my permission, you may revise the same problem multiple times per week.

:::danger
**The reflection is essential.** This reflection is part of the revision: Without it, your revision is incomplete and won’t be reviewed. Avoid saying “it was just a small mistake” or “I made a bunch of silly mistakes.” If your progress didn’t meet the objectives, there was a major reason: What was it? In math, even “small” things can make a major difference in logic and correctness. 
:::
 
:::success
Revise a problem every week! I highly recommend talking with me to make sure you understand the comments before revising. If you’re aiming to create an exemplary professionally communicated solution, talk with me first: I usually don’t make comments about all of these aspects.
:::

## Portfolio

A portfolio is a carefully curated collection of work that tells a story. Your portfolio will tell the story of you as a scientist and student of organic synthesis from the first day of class to the last. Your goal is to convincingly argue that you have met the criteria for a certain grade. Your portfolio is due at the end of the final exam period, uploaded to Canvas.

### What should be in the portfolio?

I’ll post more specific instructions later in the semester. For now, you should know that the portfolio will include:

- Some short essays that give you a chance to showcase specific aspects of your work in class. These prompts will be posted later in the semester.
- A selection of solved synthesis problems that you submitted throughout the semester (for homework, check-in meetings, and class journals) that show how you have met various criteria.
- Other artifacts that show how you’ve met criteria for a grade. For example: If you gave a presentation that didn’t become a homework, but it helps show how you’ve met grade criteria, you can include it in the portfolio. Many other things are possible. In the end, anything that supports your argument for how you’ve earned a grade is fair game!
- Your grade: A guided reflection that describes which grade you are aiming to earn, and how your portfolio shows that you’ve met the criteria for that grade.

You can revise any work or other artifacts before including them in the portfolio. Your goal is to show how you’ve met the criteria for each grade by the end of the semester. If something confused you early on, but you’ve figured it out now, show me!

**Grades:** Your portfolio is, ultimately, your chance to show how you’ve met the criteria for a certain grade. Everything you include, and everything you write, should be aimed at that goal. I will read your artifacts and reflections carefully. If you make a convincing case, you’ll earn the grade that you are aiming for!
