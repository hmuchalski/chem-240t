## Class log

  
### Day 5 (Wed, Sept 7) | Jamboard link
<!--
**Class Prep:** Review chemistry of carbonyl functional groups at aldehyde/ketone and carboxylic acid oxidation state. For Class Prep work on Problem 7 (details on Canvas). Due, as always, at 1 pm on the day of our class mtg. 
-->

### Day 4 (Wed, Aug 31) | Jamboard link

<!-- 
**Recap:** 
 -->
**Homework:** Write up solutions to problems: 1b, 2b, 5a. Use ChemDraw to prepare your work (template and sample solution on Canvas). New to ChemDraw? Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/AkkpuW322qo) that highlights some features that make drawing compounds and synthetic schemes easier.  

**Class Prep:** Review chemistry of alkyl halides, alcohols, and ethers. Review materials posted on Canvas and complete problems 3â€“6. All Class Prep assignments are due on the day of class by 1 pm. 

### Day 3 (Mon, Aug 29) | [Jamboard link](https://jamboard.google.com/d/118y_D7m-HLe8IRrF5mBRndixxNU1745TtrkWWZd0uAQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**Recap:** We discussed how retrosynthetic analysis can help design multi-step synthesis sequences. Michael presented Problem 1a during which we reviewed regioselectivity of hydrobromination (Markovnikov vs. anti-Markovnikov). Luis commented on the correlation between bulk of base and regioselectivity of E2 elimination (Hoffman vs. Zeitsev). Kiersten solved Problem 1b which helped us clarify that Grignard reaction is an example of addition. We also touched on the difference between stereoselectivity and stereospecificity using syn-dihydroxylation (with OsO4) as an example. Jason solved Problem 2a and we clarified the differences between substitution, addition, and elimination reactions. Dr. M. used it as an opportunity to emphesize the importance of communication in homework assignments. Stan shared solution to Problem 2c which helped us realize the importance of keeping track of carbons. Also, ozonolysis reaction is cool.

**Class Prep:** Review materials posted on Canvas on retrosynthesis and reaction maps. Watch videos on retrosynthetic analysis on Perusall (link on Canvas). Due Fri 8/26 at 5 pm. Work on Problems 1 and 2 from Class Prep Problem Set. Scan and upload your work as a single PDF file to Canvas by 1 pm on Monday. Volunteer to present (say so in the comment box). 


### Day 2 (Wed, Aug 24) | [Jamboard link](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1rbUKy36ynjYKBB8XeY3PwDv7T9WBgRJra3bHqHARuVo/edit?usp=sharing)

**Recap:** We used Jamboard to share facts about ourselves and where we are in relation to organic chemistry, learning new things, and growing as learners. 

### Day 1 (Mon, Aug 22)

Due to Dr. Muchalski's inability to correctly navigate time zones, the class zoom meeting was canceled and asynchronous activities were assigned.
