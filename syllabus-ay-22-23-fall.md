# Introduction

When you took the sophomore course in organic chemistry, you studied the typical reactions of halooalkanes, alkenes/alkynes, aromatic compounds and organic carbonyl compounds, etc. That was to introduce you to compound classes and to give you an understanding of how and why such reactions occur. However, the course did not focus how to design a synthetic route to prepare a given organic compound from readily available starting materials. This is a crucial aspect of organic chemistry. The design and synthesis of novel organic compounds is fundamental to the development of new medicines, agrochemicals, plastics, dyestuffs, etc. This course will introduce you to the ideas involved in synthetic design, particularly the retrosynthetic analysis (RSA).

## Assumed prior knowledge and skills

This course is a continuation of sophomore organic chemistry course (CHEM 128 series at Fresno State). I am assuming that you come to this course already familiar with concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128 and you are able to:

- communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using drawing and naming conventions;
- analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and reactivity of organic molecules; and
- analyze the interplay between electronic amd steric interactions as well as stereochemistry to predict the reactivity and properties of organic molecules and reactive intermediates (carbocations, radicals, anions, etc.).

## Course-level learning objectives

Concepts and skills listed above will be further developed and reinforced in CHEM 240T. Upon successful completion of CHEM 240T students will be able to:

- be familiar with the terminology of retrosynthetic analysis (RSA);
- describe and give examples of chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity 
- and protecting group methodology and their importance in synthetic design;
- identify synthons and their synthetic equivalents and functional group interconversions;
- use RSA to design and evaluate syntheses of target molecules of medium complexity
- evaluate a synthetic plan and identify flaws in synthetic design
- propose a plausible reaction mechanism for a given reactions

## Course workflow

:::info
Our class meetings are in the afternoon when energy levels can be low and attention muscles depleted. There will be little to no lecturing. This course is designed according to the flipped learning model, an instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities (reading assignments, lecture videos) and class time is repurposed for collaborative work and practice. This [video series](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250) highlights the basics of flipped learning.
:::

**Before class**, your task will be to review previously covered material and get familiar with the content of the upcoming class by completing the assigned reading on *Perusall*. 

**Class time** is intended to focus on *answering questions* and *doing active work*. There may be some small lectures or tutorials, but active work will be the main component since the best way to learn organic chemistry is by doing lots of problems.

**After class** you must continue to engage with the material through deliberate practice and reflection on the ideas discussed in class. As you study, you should write down your questions and put into words what you don't yet understand. This is the time when you'll work on Problem Sets.

## Topics

* Retrosynthetic Analysis (RSA)
* Disconnections via Functional Group Interconversion
* Protecting Groups
* Carbon–Carbon Bond Disconnections
* Synthesis of Compounds Containing Rings
* Stereochemistry: Prediction and Control
* Cross-Coupling Reactions
* Two-Direactional Synthesis
* Catalysis

# What to expect

The learning mode that will dominate our class meetings is deep analysis of published syntheses of case studies. The goal of this course is not to cover all strategies and tactics used in organic synthesis but to provide opportunities for development of a skill which you need to master as a graduate student: to quickly learn complex and unfamiliar science topics to the degree that you can teach them to others.

Active participation in class discussions is key to getting the most out of this class. Expect to be called to the board on a weekly basis to discuss synthetic and mechanistic problems. Don't be concerned if you feel weak in some areas. By working through a problem you will strengthen your understanding and refine thinking process. This means that it is of utter importance that you come to class prepared.

# Types of graded work

There are three types of graded work you will encounter in this course:

1. Problem sets
2. Midterm take-home exam
3. Total synthesis presentation
4. Synthesis proposal (written)
5. Proposal presentation

Problem sets are written homework assignments containing synthetic problems and mechanisms. We will review some of those problems and occasionally students will be asked to go to the board and solve the problem in front of the group. The take-home exam will be just like problem sets but bigger (more problems) and more comprehensive.

Each student will present a 15-20 min talk on a recently published total synthesis of a natural product or pharmaceutical (chosen by the instructor). This will require reading several research papers and condensing it into a short talk. 

The culminating assignment in this course will be a synthesis proposal of a natural product (chosen by the instructor). This assignment has two parts: written document (due 12/17) and presentation (dates TBA).

# Final letter grade scheme

Grade brackets are imposed by course coordinator. In the past, the grading scale followed a pattern close to the following: A = 90--100, B 80--89, C 70--79; D 60--69; and F <60.

| Grade component              | Subtotal |
|------------------------------|----------|
| Problem Sets                 | 35%      |
| Midterm take-home exam       | 20%      |
| Total synthesis presentation | 15%      |
| Synthesis Proposal           | 15%      |
| Presentation                 | 15%      |
