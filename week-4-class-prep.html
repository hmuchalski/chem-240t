<p>This assignment is shorter and has a off-cycle due date. Mostly so we have material to discuss in class and you get started on developing synthesis skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For each solution, regardless of correctness (or your confidence in its correctness), write down your thoughts, comments, thinking process.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Work on the problems in your research notebook and give each problem a good-faith effort to solve it.</li>
    <li>Provide commentary that gives the reader insight into the thinking process that went into solving the problem.</li>
    <li>It is okay if you get stuck and only have a portion of the problem. Try a different approach and describe what is holding you back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If you realize something is not working or reactions aren't compatible/appropriate - write it down.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Help me (and future self) navigate the pages&mdash;space things out and clearly mark what problem you're solving&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Scan your work into a single PDF file and upload here.</p>
<p>Before submitting the assignment, indicate in the comments box that you want to volunteer. Write "I volunteer to present" and give a list of&nbsp;2&ndash;4 problems you want to demonstrate. For multi-part problems (a, b, c, etc.) pick one sub-problem to present. I will select one or more presenters for class -- be ready!</p>
