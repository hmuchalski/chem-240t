<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Topics covered in this course include retrosynthetic analysis (RSA),
functional group interconversion, selectivity in synthesis, construction
of rings, prediction and control of stereochemistry, cross-coupling
reactions, two-directional synthesis, catalysis, green chemistry and
economy of synthesis Previous organic chemistry courses you might have
focused on introducing compound classes and types of reactions. The
course likely did not focus on how to approach synthesis of complex
molecules, which is fundamental to the development of new medicines,
agrochemicals, plastics, dyestuffs, etc.</p>
<h3 id="course-materials-and-technology">Course materials and
technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Textbook:</strong> Any college-level organic chemistry
textbook, and any edition, will work. Electronic textbooks such as
OpenStax version of <a
href="https://openstax.org/details/books/organic-chemistry?Book%20details">McMurry’s
<em>Organic Chemistry</em></a> will work but they can be difficult to
navigate, i.e., you can’t quickly flip pages back and forth.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas:</strong> The central repository for all course
materials and information is our Canvas site, accessible through <a
href="https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/110725/"><span>https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/110725/</span></a>.
The Canvas site will house assignments, grades, and links to
materials/resources.</li>
<li><strong>Personal computer:</strong> You will need a x86 class
personal computer that can run standalone desktop applications. Mobile
devices are inferior or incompatible with some software we will use,
namely ChemDraw.</li>
<li><strong>ChemDraw</strong> is available for registered Fresno State
students. You will use ChemDraw to prepare revised (clean) solutions to
homework problems.</li>
<li><strong>Document scanning tool</strong>: Assignments in this course
are designed to be prepared by hand on paper and turned in as a PDF
file. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android.
Find one that you like and learn how to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Zoom:</strong> Virtual meetings (if any) will be held via
Zoom. Links and passwords to zoom meetings will be published on
Canvas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assumed-prior-knowledge-and-skills">Assumed prior knowledge and
skills</h3>
<p>This course is a continuation of sophomore organic chemistry course
(CHEM 128 series at Fresno State). I am assuming that you come to this
course already familiar with concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128
and you are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>draw valid structures of organic molecules</li>
<li>use curved arrow notation to depict reaction mechanisms</li>
<li>analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and
reactivity</li>
<li>recognize the major classes of organic transformations (addition,
substitution, elimination, metathesis, rearrangement)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-level-learning-objectives">Course-level learning
objectives</h2>
<p>This course is a study of multi-step synthesis of organic small
molecules (&lt;1000 Da). After successful completion of the course,
students will be able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using
drawing and naming notation and using effective oral communication.</li>
<li>Weigh the issues of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity in
synthetic design by recognizing steric, electronic, and stereoelectronic
effects that direct outcome of chemical reactions.</li>
<li>Navigate the landscape of organic reactions by proposing and
evaluating synthetic plans, and making connections between reactions and
their mechanisms.</li>
<li>Demonstrate organic synthesis skills through planning, execution,
troubleshooting of multi-step synthetic sequences. Identify flaws in
synthetic plans by recognizing selectivity or efficiency issues.</li>
<li>Read and follow research articles on total syntheses of natural
products and identify strategies and tactics that allow chemists to
construct complex molecules.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="student-centered-objectives">Student-centered objectives</h3>
<p>The list above is very general and each objective has a broad scope
(course-level). We will break these down into more specific objectives
that we will focus throughout the semester. But content is only one
dimension of the studies you will undertake. In addition to the list
above you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a deep understanding of the big ideas in organic synthesis
(efficiency, selectivity, retrosynthesis).</li>
<li>Learn to communicate technical knowledge in a manner expected of a
graduate student in chemical sciences. Particularly important are your
homework, portfolio, and the class journal, which will be written to a
professional standard, as well as in-class presentations.</li>
<li>Learn chemistry from a new point of view and gain historical of
developments in organic chemistry, and understanding the importance of
this field in biology, material science, and medicine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this course is not to cover all strategies and tactics
used in organic synthesis but to provide opportunities for development
of a skill which you need as a graduate student: to quickly learn
complex and unfamiliar science topics to the degree that you can teach
them to others. Therefore, active participation in class discussions is
key to getting the most out of this class. Expect to be at the board
frequently to discuss synthetic and mechanistic problems. Don’t be
concerned if you feel weak in some areas. The goal is to identify those
areas to strengthen your understanding and refine thinking process. This
means that it is of utter importance that you come to class
prepared.</p>
<h2 id="course-workflow">Course workflow</h2>
<!-- Part of doing chemistry is productive failure: You’ll try things that don’t work; learn something from that failure; and try something new that hopefully works better. After a while, you will figure it out, and come out with a much stronger understanding of what organic chemistry is, and why we insist on teaching it to future health professionals. -->

<p>Our class meetings are in the late afternoon when energy levels can
be low and attention depleted. To reduce the risk of putting students to
sleep, formal lectures will be reduced to minimum. Instead, this course
will be ran according to the flipped learning model, an instructional
philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done
before class meetings through structured activities (reading
assignments, videos, class prep, etc.). Class time is repurposed for
collaborative work and practice. This <a
href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250">video series</a> highlights
the basics of flipped learning.</p>

<p>In the table below, <code>n</code> is the week number, starting with
the first week of classes. The course is divided into 15 weeks, with
each week focusing on a specific topic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem Set (PS) = a set of problems we will focus on that
week.</li>
<li>Class Prep (CP) = your attempt at solving the problems before
class.</li>
<li>Homework (HW) = a formal write-up (in ChemDraw) of problems from PS
(or a subset of them).</li>

<p>Important</p>
</div>
<p><strong>A word about due dates</strong><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Here is how due dates work in the workplace: They exist, and they’re
important. However, there’s a certain amount of flexibility with them.
If you need a little longer on something, you email whoever set the
deadline and ask if you can have some more time. This is usually not a
big deal, but if it happens a lot, questions will be asked.</p>
<p>That is also how due dates work in this class. Contact me to ask for
an extension on anything you need, and that’s mostly fine. It helps if
you propose a specific new deadline rather than asking for an extension
that is undefined. If you ask for lots of extensions, we’ll work
together to find ways to help you keep up. Note that you may not get
timely feedback if you need an extension on something.</p>
<p>If extenuating circumstances cause you to miss multiple assignments,
please come to office hours to discuss broader accommodations. I’ll be
flexible, but I need to know the context so that we can find the best
way moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>One important limit</strong>: Class Preps are due before
class so I can review the work, give you feedback and that you’re
prepared for class discussion (and I can choose presenters). For that
reason, Class Preps absolutely must be done before class. If you need a
little more time than the standard deadline let me know.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="learning-activities-and-assessments">Learning activities and
assessments</h2>
<p>Most of this class will center around organic synthesis problems. You
will first encounter a problem in <em>Class Prep</em>. Before class, you
will spend time attempting to solve this problem. You and classmates
will help us come to a common understanding of these questions through
your <em>in-class presentations</em> and discussion. You will write up
final solutions in <em>homework</em>, and may be allowed to revise them.
The solutions to problems will eventually become elements of your
<em>Portfolio</em> that showcases your progress. When you are especially
proud of your work, you can submit it to the <em>Class Journal</em>
too.Expect to spend a lot of time on each problem!</p>
<p>Twice during the semester you will be asked to reflect on your
progress and compare it to the criteria for grades in our course. To do
this, you will write a reflection about your work in the class, your
understanding, and your goals for the rest of the semester. The goal is
to ensure that we both agree on where you are, and what you need to do
to succeed in class.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-earn-a-grade-in-this-course">How to earn a grade in this
course</h2>
<div class="caution">
<div class="title">
<p>Caution</p>
</div>
<p>Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please
read this section carefully and</p>
</div>
<p>As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that <em>learning is a
function of many variables</em> and one of the more important ones is
<em>time</em> and that grading your work based on a single point of
data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps
unethical.</p>
<p>As an aspiring scientist you already know that good data comes from
multiple measurements. A good measure of learning has to involve
<em>multiple attempts</em> that allow the student to learn from past
mistakes and demonstrate not only a skill (datapoint), but also growth
(trend). I believe that student work should be evaluated against
<em>clearly defined standards</em> for quality, include <em>detailed
feedback</em>, and the students should be given <em>opportunities to try
again</em> to act on the feedback. This <em>feedback loop</em>, a
conversation between the student and the professor, continues until the
work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light
of the principles outlined above, in this course students can <em>revise
and resubmit some of their work</em>.</p>
<div class="note">
<div class="title">
<p>Note</p>
</div>
<p>The main goal for students in this course is to build a body of work,
a <strong>Portfolio</strong>, that will be the evidence of
<em>understanding</em> and <em>engagement</em>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="to-earn-an-a">To earn an A</h3>
<p>Consistently meet almost all of the criteria (and <strong>all
boldface criteria</strong>), missing at most 2 items:</p>
<p><em>Ways to show understanding or organic chemistry</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write high quality solutions to synthetic problems that meet
objectives (after revision, if needed).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Write several exemplary solutions throughout the semester
and/or have several solutions accepted to the class
journal.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate deep understanding of synthetic planning process
(retrosynthesis) as well as chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity
issues.</strong></li>
<li>Demonstrate understanding of the <em>12 Principles of Green
Chemistry</em> and how they apply to synthetic planning and
execution.</li>
<li>Demonstrate understanding of how reactions occur, by drawing
mechanisms using curved arrow electron-pushing style to explain reaction
outcomes and selectivity.</li>
<li>Find connections between ideas and concepts (in problems,
presentations, research articles, and other places).</li>
<li>Share your work by giving presentations or writing class journal
entries that clearly communicate your thinking process.</li>
<li>When presenting, give helpful answers to questions. When in
audience, give presenters helpful feedback, ask questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ways to show engagement with class</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete assigned pre-class work with good-faith effort.
Work to make sense of new synthetic disconnections, reactions, and
mechanisms (even if not fully correct). Try multiple approaches, include
failed attempts, and comments on the thinking process.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Volunteer to present your Class Prep work.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Volunteer to present a total synthesis case
study.</strong></li>
<li>Actively participate in discussions (this could take many
forms).</li>
<li>Complete all work, in and out of class. Actively seek out resources
to catch up if you miss class.</li>
<li>Be a leader in your groups (big and small). There are different ways
to demonstrate leadership.</li>
<li>Support classmates and help them succeed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="to-earn-a-b">To earn a B</h3>
<p>Frequently meet many of the criteria (and <strong>all but one of the
boldface criteria</strong>) listed above (missing at most 4 items) and
<em>show meaningful progress on many of the criteria you don’t fully
meet</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of meeting each criterion consistently, you may meet them
frequently: except for one or two instances, and/or you may argue that
you’ve started to meet these consistently after not doing so at the
start of the semester.</p>
<h3 id="to-earn-a-c">To earn a C</h3>
<p>Either meet <em>a few of the criteria consistently</em> (4–5 total,
<strong>and at least 2 boldface items</strong> OR <em>meet many (10–12)
criteria but less often</em>. Show meaningful progress on a few
more.</p>
<p>Do a few things very well and consistently, or do many things fairly
well but less often. For example, you might show exemplary work on most
problems, but complete few or no presentations. Or, you could meet
objectives on several problems (with no exemplary work), present several
times, etc.</p>

<h2 id="class-prep-and-research-notebook">Class Prep and Research
Notebook</h2>
<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and Purpose</h3>
<p>A new set of problems, focusing on specific topics, will be posted
weekly by Friday. Your goal is to attempt to solve these problems before
the class or make as much progress as possible. This will ensure that
you are ready to take an active part in our class presentations and
discussions. The research notebook is a place to keep and organize your
notes on reading material, research, and drafts of problems.</p>
<p>In short, I’m asking you to attempt big, real, difficult problems
before class. <em>This is not easy!</em> But, it’s also as real as
synthetic organic chemistry gets. You will learn what to do when you
don’t know what to do; how to find and try multiple approaches; the
benefits of collaborating in order to generate new ideas and understand
old ones; and how past mistakes can help you improve in the future.</p>
<p>Think of Class Prep as a demonstration that you studied the topic,
and to show that you are committed to understanding and solving the
required problems. <em>Correctness is not a factor—it’s OK if this work
contains errors.</em> The goal is to be prepared.</p>
<p>Class Prep work should take most of the time allocated to this
course. Start as soon as the problems are posted.</p>
<p><strong>Research notebook</strong>. You will need a way to keep
handwritten notes organized. I suggest a bound notebook or a 3-ring
binder that is dedicated to this class. Keep all of your Class Prep work
together, dated and ordered, so that stuff it’s easy to find. You will
often refer to your past work, so it’s important to keep it organized. I
may occasionally ask to see your research notebook, to ensure it is
complete and organized.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-work-on-class-prep-problems">How to work on Class Prep
problems</h3>
<p>Look up the reading and problems in Canvas. Read the text carefully,
for full understanding. If there are new reactions or mechanisms, create
examples to help you understand them. For each problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start each problem on a new page, label with the full problem
number/statement, and the date. Better yet, copy the problem on the
answer page.</li>
<li>Work to solve the problem or propose the synthesis. This is a
draft—aim to understand the ideas and don’t feel constrained by the
format and style.</li>
<li>Include comments and notes (in text) that will help me (and your
future self)understand these unstructured notes and follow along.</li>
<li>Keep your mistakes! Don’t erase anything. Sooner or later you will
realize that your proposed synthesis leads to a dead end. If you
realized the synthesis will not work, acknowledge, annotate, and try
again. Don’t erase! Write a comment explaining why you believe the
reaction will not work and propose something better. These comments will
help me understand your thinking process and will help you when you
review your work later.</li>
<li>When done, scan and upload your Class Prep work to Canvas by the due
date. In the “Comments” text box, indicate which problems (if any) you
would be willing to present in class.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] Collaboration with others You are allowed to collaborate with
other on Class Prep problems but you must give credit next to ideas and
key insights. See Academic Integrity section below for details.</p>

You can do this by presenting in class or publishing in our class
journal. Presentations and class journals are great ways to show your
engagement with chemistry ideas and with your peers. Be willing to go
out on a limb and share your thoughts!</p>
<h3 id="presentations-in-class">Presentations in class</h3>
<p>When you submit your Class Prep assignment, indicate which problems
you are willing to present in class and be ready to present your
solution when called. I will select presenters based on who has
volunteered, and who has presented the least recently. I may ask
multiple students to present, if their solutions are different or
illustrate interesting issues. It’s likely that <strong>you will not
present every time you volunteer</strong>.</p>
<p>The goal of a presentation is to communicate your understanding of an
idea in a helpful way, and to create discussions that help everyone
understand it better. Correctness and clear communication are equally
important. Mistakes and the discussions following them are some of the
most valuable ways for everyone to learn! (See the section about grading
for more details.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP] How to volunteer to present? Before you submit your Class Prep
assignment, leave a comment in the text box indicating which problems
you are willing to present in class.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="formal-problem-write-ups-chemdraw-homework">Formal problem
write-ups (ChemDraw homework)</h2>
<p>I will select problems from the weekly set and assign as a formal
write-up. Your task will be to compose a correct, complete, convincing,
and clear solutions to the selected problems. This should be based on
your own Class Prep work, presentations, and class discussions.</p>
<p>Your work should meet the objectives listed in the assignment and
there may be a different focus on different weeks. These will help you
practice different aspects of communication throughout the semester.
Homeworks must be prepared as ChemDraw documents (templates will be
available on Canvas).</p>
<h3 id="revisions-of-homework-assignments">Revisions of homework
assignments</h3>
<p>You may revise and resubmit homework problems with some
limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You may submit one revision per week.</li>
<li>The revision must be submitted within 1 week of receiving
feedback.</li>
<li>Work that received a mark of <code>non assessable</code> is
ineligible for revision.</li>
<li>The revision must include a reflection that explains why your work
received a lower mark, what you did to improve (be specific!), and how
you have demonstrated that in the revised version.</li>
</ol>
<div class="caution">
<div class="title">
<p>Caution</p>
</div>
<p>The reflection is and integral part of the revision. Without it, your
revision is incomplete and won’t be marked. If your progress didn’t meet
the objectives, there was a major reason and you must explain. In
synthesis, even “small” things can have a major consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<div class="title">
<p>Tip</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Work on revisions on a regular basis. Talk to the professor to make
sure you understand the feedback before submitting a revision.</p>
<h3 id="publish-in-the-class-journal">Publish in the Class Journal</h3>
<p>I will post a list of all problems that are open for Class Journal
submissions. You may “claim” a problem by emailing me. I will add your
name and the date on the list and you will have 1 week to submit an
high-quality solution. The formal write up may include short essays on a
topic related to the problem.</p>
<p>You may only have one problem claimed at a time. Just like with
presentations, if more than one person claims a problem at the same
time, I will choose based on who has completed fewer journals.</p>
<p>I will review your submission and choose whether to accept it.
Journal problems must be fully correct and illustrate excellent
communication. To achieve this, I might ask you to make revisions before
accepting your work.</p>
<h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
<p>A portfolio is a carefully curated collection of work that tells a
story of you as a scientist and student of organic synthesis from the
first day of class to the last. Your goal is to make a convincing case
that you have met the criteria for the final grade you expect. Your
portfolio is due on the last day of instruction.</p>
<p>You can revise any work or other artifacts before including them in
the portfolio. Your goal is to show how you’ve met the criteria for each
grade by the end of the semester. If something confused you early on,
but you’ve figured it out now, show me!</p>

<h2 id="policies-and-disclaimers">Policies and disclaimers</h2>
<h3 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and participation</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class
sessions. Excuses and exceptions will be interpreted by following
university’s <a
href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM
232: Policy on Student Absence</a>.</p>
<h3 id="late-workmake-up-policy">Late work/make-up policy</h3>
<p>If you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to check on
announcements made while you were away. The course attendance policy
follows university’s <a
href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM
232: Policy on Student Absence</a>. Late assignments will not be
accepted for a grade unless the absence meets the guidelines set forth
by the university policy <a

232: Policy on Student Absence</a></p>
<h3 id="technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when
submitting work</h3>
<p>For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility
to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary,
even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your
responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for
example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable
or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid
grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to
upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try
again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload
it successfully.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-and-collaboration">Academic Integrity and
Collaboration<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></h3>
<p>In this class, we will form a <em>research community</em>. Your
primary goal in this course is to develop a deep personal understanding
and expertise in organic synthesis. Collaboration and cooperation are
extremely helpful in the learning process, and we will have many
opportunities for collaborative work. However, there are some portions
of our class that must be done independently.</p>
<p>This course is subject to the Fresno State course policies and the
student code. This document establishes guidelines and expands and
clarifies these policies with respect to all work done in CHEM 240T this
semester. Be sure to read it carefully and honor it fully.</p>
<p>The student code defines academic misconduct as any action or
behavior that misrepresents one’s contributions to or the results of any
scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination.
This includes cheating, collusion, dual submission, falsification, and
plagiarism.</p>
<p><strong>Who can I collaborate with?</strong> In CHEM 240T,
collaboration is permitted and even encouraged in most circumstances. In
particular, your team is a key resource for understanding new ideas. You
may only collaborate with students currently enrolled in CHEM 240T.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging collaboration.</strong> In all work, clearly
state the name(s) of the person(s) you collaborated with on each
problem. If you follow the instructions in this document, this will not
harm your grade.</p>
<p><strong>Specific academic honesty expectations:</strong> The
following are guidelines for avoiding academic misconduct in
assignments. The list is intended to be helpful but not exhaustive. If
you are unsure about the appropriateness of some form of assistance on
an assignment, you should always ask me.</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, you may work with your peers on Class Prep assignments,
as long as you acknowledge them and follow the requirements below.</li>
<li>On every homework problem, every step of every solution must be one
that you understand yourself and that you have generated by thinking
about the problem. You are permitted to collaborate on big ideas and
hints with classmates but you must always write solutions independently.
All collaboration on homework exercises should occur when your
collaborators are at essentially the same stage of the problem solution
as yourself. For example, if you have not yet started problem #4 and you
ask a friend (who has already completed it), “How did you do problem
4?”, this counts as academic misconduct. The resulting work is not and
cannot be considered your own.</li>
<li>Some homework problems will not allow collaboration. This helps to
ensure that you can work independently to prove key results. In such
cases, the only help allowed is consultation with the professor.</li>
<li>Copying a solution, or any part of a solution, from any source
(friend, Internet, book, AI etc.) in any setting, constitutes academic
misconduct.</li>
<li>On any assignment, basing your work on the efforts of another
student who previously completed this course, or one like it, is
considered academic misconduct. Use of any shared or solicited
materials, including those posted on Chegg or similar sites, is academic
misconduct. Class materials may not be shared beyond other students in
this class, including posting your solutions on Chegg or similar
sites.</li>
<li>You may not seek the help of an instructor or tutor (other than me)
unless you first discuss this with me in advance. If you do not verify
that this is acceptable before seeking help, this will be considered
academic misconduct. I am always willing to discuss any aspect of the
course with you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consequences of academic dishonesty.</strong> Evidence of
dishonest behavior on any assignment will result, at a minimum, in not
being able to use that work as evidence in your grade check-ins and
final portfolio. In severe cases, the minimum penalty will be failure of
the course. Peers who willingly assist others in acts of academic
misconduct are equally guilty, and will suffer similar penalties. In all
cases, violations will be considered according to APM 235 <a
href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf"><span>http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf</span></a>.</p>
<p>[!NOTE] I want you to succeed!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to develop a deep, personal understanding of the material
we study so that you become a better student of mathematics who can go
on to do well in all of your future endeavors. Every part of this course
structure – including both collaborative work and restrictions on
collaboration – are intended to help you with this. You will often
struggle, and that’s intentional – struggle (and eventual success!) is
essential to learning. Indeed, productively failing (and learning from
it) is part of your final grade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all aspects of the course, I am happy to discuss chemistry with
you. I will never simply give you an answer, but I will offer direction
and guidance that will assist you in coming up with a solution on your
own. This is by far the most satisfying way to solve a problem, and the
struggle is worth it. I hope you will make frequent use of my office
hours and your peers. You are always welcome to discuss your questions
or concerns with me at any time.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-the-course-after-the-census-date">Dropping the course
after the census date</h3>
<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected
condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that
unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student’s ability to attend
class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be
acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the
department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the
appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that
substantiates the condition.</p>
<p>Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable “serious
and compelling reason” within the University policy, nor is
dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism-detection">Plagiarism Detection</h3>
<p>The campus subscribes to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service,
through Canvas. You will need to submit written assignments to Turnitin.
Student work will be used for plagiarism detection and for no other
purpose. The student may indicate in writing to the instructor that
he/she refuses to participate in the plagiarism detection process, in
which case the instructor can use other electronic means to verify the
originality of their work. Turnitin Originality Reports WILL NOT be
available for your viewing.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>If there are questions or concerns that you have about this course
that you and I are not able to resolve, please feel free to contact the
Chair of the department to discuss the matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chair’s name: Dr. Eric Person (interim chair)</li>
<li>Department name: Chemistry and Biochemistry</li>

<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>All course materials, including but not limited to the syllabus,
readings, quiz questions, exam questions, and assignments prepared by
the instructor are property of the instructor and University. Students
are prohibited from posting course materials online (e.g., Course Hero)
and from selling course materials to or being paid for providing
materials to any person or commercial firm without the express written
permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will
constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright
violation. Audio and video recordings of class lectures are prohibited
unless I give you explicit permission in advance. Students with an
official letter from the Services for Students with Disabilities office
may record the class if SSD has approved that service. Otherwise,
recordings of lectures are included in the intellectual property notice
described above.</p>
<h3 id="student-ratings-of-instruction">Student Ratings of
Instruction</h3>
<p>In the final weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete a
short survey to pro-vide feedback about this class. The primary goal of
student ratings is to help your instructor improve the class. Feedback
will also be reviewed by the department chair and the college dean. You
will be given 15 minutes of class time to complete student ratings.
Please offer feedback honestly and thoughtfully. Your participation is
appreciated. You can access your student rating surveys and get more

<h2 id="emergency-information">Emergency Information</h2>
<p>In the event of an emergency, everyone in the campus community
becomes a partner in the response. To ensure you are prepared and remain
calm you must make yourself familiar with campus protocols. To contact
the Fresno State Police Department call 559.278.8400 from your cell
phone or 911 from a campus phone. Prior to an emergency, assess your
environment for options depending on the emergency. Identify all
possible exit routes, in an emergency always use the closest most safe
exit. Once you exit the building go to the predetermined evacuation
assembly point, if that is unavailable then go to an open safe space
away from the emergency. Identify where and how you can secure yourself
inside if you need to shelter in place or hide from a threat. Be
prepared to help guide those around you and assist individuals who may
be in need. Additional information can be found at <a
