<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Topics covered in this course include retrosynthetic analysis (RSA), functional group interconversion, selectivity in synthesis, construction of rings, prediction and control of stereochemistry, cross-coupling reactions, two-directional synthesis, catalysis, green chemistry and economy of synthesis Previous organic chemistry courses you might have focused on introducing compound classes and types of reactions. The course likely did not focus on how to approach synthesis of complex molecules, which is fundamental to the development of new medicines, agrochemicals, plastics, dyestuffs, etc.</p>
<h3 id="course-materials-and-technology">Course materials and technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Textbook:</strong> Any college-level organic chemistry textbook, and any edition, will work. Electronic textbooks such as OpenStax version of <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/organic-chemistry?Book%20details">McMurry's <em>Organic Chemistry</em></a> will work but they can be difficult to navigate, i.e., you can't quickly flip pages back and forth.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas:</strong> The central repository for all course materials and information is our Canvas site, accessible through <a href="https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/110725/">https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/110725/</a>. The Canvas site will house assignments, grades, and links to materials/resources.</li>
<li><strong>Personal computer:</strong> You will need a x86 class personal computer that can run standalone desktop applications. Mobile devices are inferior or incompatible with some software we will use, namely ChemDraw.</li>
<li><strong>ChemDraw</strong> is available for registered Fresno State students. You will use ChemDraw to prepare revised (clean) solutions to homework problems.</li>
<li><strong>Document scanning tool</strong>: Assignments in this course are designed to be prepared by hand on paper and turned in as a PDF file. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Zoom:</strong> Virtual meetings (if any) will be held via Zoom. Links and passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assumed-prior-knowledge-and-skills">Assumed prior knowledge and skills</h3>
<p>This course is a continuation of sophomore organic chemistry course (CHEM 128 series at Fresno State). I am assuming that you come to this course already familiar with concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128 and you are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>draw valid structures of organic molecules</li>
<li>use curved arrow notation to depict reaction mechanisms</li>
<li>analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and reactivity</li>
<li>recognize the major classes of organic transformations (addition, substitution, elimination, metathesis, rearrangement)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-level-learning-objectives">Course-level learning objectives</h2>
<p>This course is a study of multi-step synthesis of organic small molecules (&lt;1000 Da). After successful completion of the course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using drawing and naming notation and using effective oral communication.</li>
<li>Weigh the issues of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity in synthetic design by recognizing steric, electronic, and stereoelectronic effects that direct outcome of chemical reactions.</li>
<li>Navigate the landscape of organic reactions by proposing and evaluating synthetic plans, and making connections between reactions and their mechanisms.</li>
<li>Demonstrate organic synthesis skills through planning, execution, troubleshooting of multi-step synthetic sequences. Identify flaws in synthetic plans by recognizing selectivity or efficiency issues.</li>
<li>Read and follow research articles on total syntheses of natural products and identify strategies and tactics that allow chemists to construct complex molecules.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="student-centered-objectives">Student-centered objectives</h3>
<p>The list above is very general and each objective has a broad scope (course-level). We will break these down into more specific objectives that we will focus throughout the semester. But content is only one dimension of the studies you will undertake. In addition to the list above you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a deep understanding of the big ideas in organic synthesis (efficiency, selectivity, retrosynthesis).</li>
<li>Learn to communicate technical knowledge in a manner expected of a graduate student in chemical sciences. Particularly important are your homework, portfolio, and the class journal, which will be written to a professional standard, as well as in-class presentations.</li>
<li>Learn chemistry from a new point of view and gain historical of developments in organic chemistry, and understanding the importance of this field in biology, material science, and medicine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this course is not to cover all strategies and tactics used in organic synthesis but to provide opportunities for development of a skill which you need as a graduate student: to quickly learn complex and unfamiliar science topics to the degree that you can teach them to others. Therefore, active participation in class discussions is key to getting the most out of this class. Expect to be at the board frequently to discuss synthetic and mechanistic problems. Don't be concerned if you feel weak in some areas. The goal is to identify those areas to strengthen your understanding and refine thinking process. This means that it is of utter importance that you come to class prepared.</p>
<h2 id="course-workflow">Course workflow</h2>
<!-- Part of doing chemistry is productive failure: You’ll try things that don’t work; learn something from that failure; and try something new that hopefully works better. After a while, you will figure it out, and come out with a much stronger understanding of what organic chemistry is, and why we insist on teaching it to future health professionals. -->

To reduce the risk of putting students to sleep, formal lectures will be reduced to minimum. Instead, this course will be ran according to the flipped learning model, an instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities (reading assignments, videos, class prep, etc.). Class time is repurposed for collaborative work and practice. This <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250">video series</a> highlights the basics of flipped learning.</p>

<p>Here is how due dates work in the workplace: They exist, and they’re important. However, there’s a certain amount of flexibility with them. If you need a little longer on something, you email whoever set the deadline and ask if you can have some more time. This is usually not a big deal, but if it happens a lot, questions will be asked.</p>
<p>That is also how due dates work in this class. Contact me to ask for an extension on anything you need, and that’s mostly fine. It helps if you propose a specific new deadline rather than asking for an extension that is undefined. If you ask for lots of extensions, we’ll work together to find ways to help you keep up. Note that you may not get timely feedback if you need an extension on something.</p>
<p>If extenuating circumstances cause you to miss multiple assignments, please come to office hours to discuss broader accommodations. I’ll be flexible, but I need to know the context so that we can find the best way moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>One important limit</strong>: Class Preps are due before class so I can review the work, give you feedback and that you’re prepared for class discussion (and I can choose presenters). For that reason, Class Preps absolutely must be done before class. If you need a little more time than the standard deadline let me know.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="learning-activities-and-assessments">Learning activities and assessments</h2>
<p>Most of this class will center around organic synthesis problems. You will first encounter a problem in <em>Class Prep</em>. Before class, you will spend time attempting to solve this problem. You and classmates will help us come to a common understanding of these questions through your <em>in-class presentations</em> and discussion. You will write up final solutions in <em>homework</em>, and may be allowed to revise them. The solutions to problems will eventually become elements of your <em>Portfolio</em> that showcases your progress. When you are especially proud of your work, you can submit it to the <em>Class Journal</em> too.Expect to spend a lot of time on each problem!</p>
<p>Twice during the semester you will be asked to reflect on your progress and compare it to the criteria for grades in our course. To do this, you will write a reflection about your work in the class, your understanding, and your goals for the rest of the semester. The goal is to ensure that we both agree on where you are, and what you need to do to succeed in class.</p>

</div>
<p>As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that <em>learning is a function of many variables</em> and one of the more important ones is <em>time</em> and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical.</p>
<p>As an aspiring scientist you already know that good data comes from multiple measurements. A good measure of learning has to involve <em>multiple attempts</em> that allow the student to learn from past mistakes and demonstrate not only a skill (datapoint), but also growth (trend). I believe that student work should be evaluated against <em>clearly defined standards</em> for quality, include <em>detailed feedback</em>, and the students should be given <em>opportunities to try again</em> to act on the feedback. This <em>feedback loop</em>, a conversation between the student and the professor, continues until the work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course students can <em>revise and resubmit some of their work</em>.</p>

<p>Frequently meet many of the criteria (and <strong>all but one of the boldface criteria</strong>) listed above (missing at most 4 items) and <em>show meaningful progress on many of the criteria you don't fully meet</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of meeting each criterion consistently, you may meet them frequently: except for one or two instances, and/or you may argue that you’ve started to meet these consistently after not doing so at the start of the semester.</p>
<h3 id="to-earn-a-c">To earn a C</h3>
<p>Either meet <em>a few of the criteria consistently</em> (4--5 total, <strong>and at least 2 boldface items</strong> OR <em>meet many (10--12) criteria but less often</em>. Show meaningful progress on a few more.</p>
<p>Do a few things very well and consistently, or do many things fairly well but less often. For example, you might show exemplary work on most problems, but complete few or no presentations. Or, you could meet objectives on several problems (with no exemplary work), present several times, etc.</p>

<h3 id="description-and-purpose">Description and Purpose</h3>
<p>A new set of problems, focusing on specific topics, will be posted weekly by Friday. Your goal is to attempt to solve these problems before the class or make as much progress as possible. This will ensure that you are ready to take an active part in our class presentations and discussions. The research notebook is a place to keep and organize your notes on reading material, research, and drafts of problems.</p>
<p>In short, I’m asking you to attempt big, real, difficult problems before class. <em>This is not easy!</em> But, it’s also as real as synthetic organic chemistry gets. You will learn what to do when you don’t know what to do; how to find and try multiple approaches; the benefits of collaborating in order to generate new ideas and understand old ones; and how past mistakes can help you improve in the future.</p>
<p>Think of Class Prep as a demonstration that you studied the topic, and to show that you are committed to understanding and solving the required problems. <em>Correctness is not a factor---it’s OK if this work contains errors.</em> The goal is to be prepared.</p>
<p>Class Prep work should take most of the time allocated to this course. Start as soon as the problems are posted.</p>
<p><strong>Research notebook</strong>. You will need a way to keep handwritten notes organized. I suggest a bound notebook or a 3-ring binder that is dedicated to this class. Keep all of your Class Prep work together, dated and ordered, so that stuff it’s easy to find. You will often refer to your past work, so it’s important to keep it organized. I may occasionally ask to see your research notebook, to ensure it is complete and organized.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-work-on-class-prep-problems">How to work on Class Prep problems</h3>
<p>Look up the reading and problems in Canvas. Read the text carefully, for full understanding. If there are new reactions or mechanisms, create examples to help you understand them. For each problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start each problem on a new page, label with the full problem number/statement, and the date. Better yet, copy the problem on the answer page.</li>
<li>Work to solve the problem or propose the synthesis. This is a draft---aim to understand the ideas and don't feel constrained by the format and style.</li>
<li>Include comments and notes (in text) that will help me (and your future self)understand these unstructured notes and follow along.</li>
<li>Keep your mistakes! Don't erase anything. Sooner or later you will realize that your proposed synthesis leads to a dead end. If you realized the synthesis will not work, acknowledge, annotate, and try again. Don't erase! Write a comment explaining why you believe the reaction will not work and propose something better. These comments will help me understand your thinking process and will help you when you review your work later.</li>
<li>When done, scan and upload your Class Prep work to Canvas by the due date. In the “Comments” text box, indicate which problems (if any) you would be willing to present in class.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="presentations-and-the-class-journal">Presentations and the Class Journal</h2>
<p>A central part of this class is sharing your ideas with classmates. You can do this by presenting in class or publishing in our class journal. Presentations and class journals are great ways to show your engagement with chemistry ideas and with your peers. Be willing to go out on a limb and share your thoughts!</p>
<h3 id="presentations-in-class">Presentations in class</h3>
<p>When you submit your Class Prep assignment, indicate which problems you are willing to present in class and be ready to present your solution when called. I will select presenters based on who has volunteered, and who has presented the least recently. I may ask multiple students to present, if their solutions are different or illustrate interesting issues. It's likely that <strong>you will not present every time you volunteer</strong>.</p>
<p>The goal of a presentation is to communicate your understanding of an idea in a helpful way, and to create discussions that help everyone understand it better. Correctness and clear communication are equally important. Mistakes and the discussions following them are some of the most valuable ways for everyone to learn! (See the section about grading for more details.)</p>

<p>I will select problems from the weekly set and assign as a formal write-up. Your task will be to compose a correct, complete, convincing, and clear solutions to the selected problems. This should be based on your own Class Prep work, presentations, and class discussions.</p>
<p>Your work should meet the objectives listed in the assignment and there may be a different focus on different weeks. These will help you practice different aspects of communication throughout the semester. Homeworks must be prepared as ChemDraw documents (templates will be available on Canvas).</p>
<h3 id="revisions-of-homework-assignments">Revisions of homework assignments</h3>
<p>You may revise and resubmit homework problems with some limitations:</p>

<h3 id="publish-in-the-class-journal">Publish in the Class Journal</h3>
<p>I will post a list of all problems that are open for Class Journal submissions.
You may “claim” a problem by emailing me. I will add your name and the date on the list and you will have 1 week to submit an high-quality solution. The formal write up may include short essays on a topic related to the problem.</p>
<p>You may only have one problem claimed at a time. Just like with presentations, if more than one person claims a problem at the same time, I will choose based on who has completed fewer journals.</p>
<p>I will review your submission and choose whether to accept it. Journal problems must be fully correct and illustrate excellent communication. To achieve this, I might ask you to make revisions before accepting your work.</p>
<h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
<p>A portfolio is a carefully curated collection of work that tells a story of you as a scientist and student of organic synthesis from the first day of class to the last. Your goal is to make a convincing case that you have met the criteria for the final grade you expect. Your portfolio is due on the last day of instruction.</p>
<p>You can revise any work or other artifacts before including them in the portfolio. Your goal is to show how you’ve met the criteria for each grade by the end of the semester. If something confused you early on, but you’ve figured it out now, show me!</p>

<h2 id="policies-and-disclaimers">Policies and disclaimers</h2>
<h3 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and participation</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class sessions. Excuses and exceptions will be interpreted by following university's <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM 232: Policy on Student Absence</a>.</p>
<h3 id="late-workmake-up-policy">Late work/make-up policy</h3>
<p>If you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to check on announcements made while you were away. The course attendance policy follows university’s <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM 232: Policy on Student Absence</a>. Late assignments will not be accepted for a grade unless the absence meets the guidelines set forth by the university policy <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM 232: Policy on Student Absence</a></p>
<h3 id="technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when submitting work</h3>
<p>For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-and-collaboration2">Academic Integrity and Collaboration<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></h3>
<p>In this class, we will form a <em>research community</em>. Your primary goal in this course is to develop a deep personal understanding and expertise in organic synthesis. Collaboration and cooperation are extremely helpful in the learning process, and we will have many opportunities for collaborative work. However, there are some portions of our class that must be done independently.</p>
<p>This course is subject to the Fresno State course policies and the student code. This document establishes guidelines and expands and clarifies these policies with respect to all work done in CHEM 240T this semester. Be sure to read it carefully and honor it fully.</p>
<p>The student code defines academic misconduct as any action or behavior that misrepresents one’s contributions to or the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination. This includes cheating, collusion, dual submission, falsification, and plagiarism.</p>
<p><strong>Who can I collaborate with?</strong> In CHEM 240T, collaboration is permitted and even encouraged in most circumstances. In particular, your team is a key resource for understanding new ideas. You may only collaborate with students currently enrolled in CHEM 240T.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging collaboration.</strong> In all work, clearly state the name(s) of the person(s) you collaborated with on each problem. If you follow the instructions in this document, this will not harm your grade.</p>
<p><strong>Specific academic honesty expectations:</strong> The following are guidelines for avoiding academic misconduct in assignments. The list is intended to be helpful but not exhaustive. If you are unsure about the appropriateness of some form of assistance on an assignment, you should always ask me.</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, you may work with your peers on Class Prep assignments, as long as you acknowledge them and follow the requirements below.</li>
<li>On every homework problem, every step of every solution must be one that you understand yourself and that you have generated by thinking about the problem. You are permitted to collaborate on big ideas and hints with classmates but you must always write solutions independently. All collaboration on homework exercises should occur when your collaborators are at essentially the same stage of the problem solution as yourself. For example, if you have not yet started problem #4 and you ask a friend (who has already completed it), &quot;How did you do problem 4?&quot;, this counts as academic misconduct. The resulting work is not and cannot be considered your own.</li>
<li>Some homework problems will not allow collaboration. This helps to ensure that you can work independently to prove key results. In such cases, the only help allowed is consultation with the professor.</li>
<li>Copying a solution, or any part of a solution, from any source (friend, Internet, book, AI etc.) in any setting, constitutes academic misconduct.</li>
<li>On any assignment, basing your work on the efforts of another student who previously completed this course, or one like it, is considered academic misconduct. Use of any shared or solicited materials, including those posted on Chegg or similar sites, is academic misconduct. Class materials may not be shared beyond other students in this class, including posting your solutions on Chegg or similar sites.</li>
<li>You may not seek the help of an instructor or tutor (other than me) unless you first discuss this with me in advance. If you do not verify that this is acceptable before seeking help, this will be considered academic misconduct. I am always willing to discuss any aspect of the course with you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consequences of academic dishonesty.</strong> Evidence of dishonest behavior on any assignment will result, at a minimum, in not being able to use that work as evidence in your grade check-ins and final portfolio. In severe cases, the minimum penalty will be failure of the course. Peers who willingly assist others in acts of academic misconduct are equally guilty, and will suffer similar penalties. In all cases, violations will be considered according to APM 235 <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf">http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf</a>.</p>

Every part of this course structure – including both collaborative work and restrictions on collaboration – are intended to help you with this. You will often struggle, and that’s intentional – struggle (and eventual success!) is essential to learning. Indeed, productively failing (and learning from it) is part of your final grade.</p>
</div>
<p>In all aspects of the course, I am happy to discuss chemistry with you. I will never simply give you an answer, but I will offer direction and guidance that will assist you in coming up with a solution on your own. This is by far the most satisfying way to solve a problem, and the struggle is worth it.
I hope you will make frequent use of my office hours and your peers. You are always welcome to discuss your questions or concerns with me at any time.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-the-course-after-the-census-date">Dropping the course after the census date</h3>
<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.</p>
<p>Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable &quot;serious and compelling reason&quot; within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism-detection">Plagiarism Detection</h3>
<p>The campus subscribes to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service, through Canvas. You will need to submit written assignments to Turnitin. Student work will be used for plagiarism detection and for no other purpose. The student may indicate in writing to the instructor that he/she refuses to participate in the plagiarism detection process, in which case the instructor can use other electronic means to verify the originality of their work. Turnitin Originality Reports WILL NOT be available for your viewing.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>If there are questions or concerns that you have about this course that you and I are not able to resolve, please feel free to contact the Chair of the department to discuss the matter.</p>

<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>All course materials, including but not limited to the syllabus, readings, quiz questions, exam questions, and assignments prepared by the instructor are property of the instructor and University. Students are prohibited from posting course materials online (e.g., Course Hero) and from selling course materials to or being paid for providing materials to any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright violation. Audio and video recordings of class lectures are prohibited unless I give you explicit permission in advance. Students with an official letter from the Services for Students with Disabilities office may record the class if SSD has approved that service. Otherwise, recordings of lectures are included in the intellectual property notice described above.</p>
<h3 id="student-ratings-of-instruction">Student Ratings of Instruction</h3>
<p>In the final weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete a short survey to pro-vide feedback about this class. The primary goal of student ratings is to help your instructor improve the class. Feedback will also be reviewed by the department chair and the college dean. You will be given 15 minutes of class time to complete student ratings. Please offer feedback honestly and thoughtfully. Your participation is appreciated. You can access your student rating surveys and get more information at <a href="https://sites.google.com/mail.fresnostate.edu/fresno-state-sri/home">Fresno State Student Ratings for Instruction (SRI)</a></p>
