## Introduction

When you took the sophomore course in organic chemistry, the goal of that course was to introduce you to compound classes and types of reactions. The course did not focus on how to approach synthesis of complex molecules from readily available starting materials, which is fundamental to the development of new medicines, agrochemicals, plastics, dyestuffs, etc. 

Topics covered in this course include retrosynthetic analysis (RSA), functional group interconversions, selectivity in synthesis, construction of rings, prediction and control of stereochemistry, cross-coupling reactions, two-direactional synthesis, catalysis, green chemistry and economy of synthesis.

### Course materials and technology

- **Textbook:** Any college-level organic chemistry textbook, and any edition, will work. I don't recommend electronic versions as they are difficult to navigate, i.e., you can't quickly flip pages back and forth.[^3]
- **Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and information is our Canvas site, accessible through [https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/63109](https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/63109). The Canvas site will house assignments, grades, and links to materials/resources.
- **Personal computer:** You will need a x86 class personal computer that can run standalone desktop applications. Mobile devices can be used but they are inferior or incompatible with software we will use.
- **ChemDraw** is available for registered Fresno State students. You will use ChemDraw to type revised solutions to homework problems. 
- **Document scanning tool**: Assignments in this course are designed to be prepared by hand on paper and turned in as a PDF file. Few people own document scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can convert paper documents into PDFs. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.
- **Zoom:** Virtual meetings (if any) will be held via Zoom. Links and passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas.

### Assumed prior knowledge and skills

This course is a continuation of sophomore organic chemistry course (CHEM 128 series at Fresno State). I am assuming that you come to this course already familiar with concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128 and you are able to:

- draw valid structures of organic molecules
- use curved arrow notation to depict reaction mechanisms
- analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and reactivity

## Course-level learning objectives

This course is a study of organic chemistry in the context of multi-step synthesis of complex small molecules (<1000 Da). After successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

1. Communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using drawing and naming notation and using effective oral communication.
2. Weigh the issues of chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity in synthetic design by identifying steric, electronic, and stereoelectronic effects that influence outcome of reactions
3. Navigate the landscape of organic reactions by proposing examples and non-examples of syntheses, and making connections between reactions and their mechanisms. 
4. Demonstrate organic synthesis skills through planning, execution, troubleshooting of multi-step synthetic sequences. Identify flaws in synthetic plans by recognizing selectivity or efficiency issues. 
5. Read and follow research articles on total syntheses of natural products and identify strategies and tactics that allow chemists to construct complex molecules.

### Student-centered objectives

These are the overarching university goals for this class. We will break these down into more specific objectives throughout the semester. In addition to everything above, we will focus on some important objectives that go beyond this class. Specifically, I want you to...

- Succeed! Specifically, I want you to develop a deep understanding of the ideas outlined above. You can expect me to push you in many ways to help you achieve these. As a result, this class will not be easy, but that’s good: You learn by struggling!
- Learn to write and present in a manner that further improves your scientific communication skills. We will work on this in almost every aspect of class. Particularly important are your homework, portfolio, and the class journal, which will be written to a professional standard, as well as in-class presentations. 
- Learn chemistry from a new point of view. This includes a deep knowledge of reactions and their mechanisms. It also involves learning the why of the historical and modern development of organic synthesis, and deeply understanding the importance of this field in biology, material science, and medicine. 

The goal of this course is not to cover all strategies and tactics used in organic synthesis but to provide opportunities for development of a skill which you need as a graduate student: to quickly learn complex and unfamiliar science topics to the degree that you can teach them to others. Therefore, active participation in class discussions is key to getting the most out of this class. Expect to be at the board frequently to discuss synthetic and mechanistic problems. Don't be concerned if you feel weak in some areas. The goal is to identify those areas to strengthen your understanding and refine thinking process. This means that it is of utter importance that you come to class prepared.

## Course workflow

This class will be **face to face**. If Fresno State moves to a remote format at any point, or if the instructor or a substantial number of students are absent due to quarantine or isolation, we will continue to hold class at the regular time in synchronous format via Zoom. Watch Canvas and your Fresno State email for announcements

This class will be hard work. Part of doing chemistry is productive failure: You’ll try things that don’t work; learn something from that failure; and try something new that works a bit better. After a while, you will figure it out, and come out with a much stronger understanding of what organic chemistry is, and why we insist on teaching it to future health professionals.

:::info
Our class meetings are in the afternoon when energy levels can be low and attention muscles depleted. To reduce the risk of falling asleep, there will be little to no lecturing. Instead, this course is going to be ran according to the flipped learning model, an instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities (reading assignments, videos, class prep, etc.). Class time is repurposed for collaborative work and practice. This [video series](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250) highlights the basics of flipped learning.
:::

Here’s what you will do at each point during the week. All times are Fresno, CA time (Pacific).

1. **Monday Class Prep (1--2 hours)**: Work on the Class Prep assignment for the upcoming Monday class (posted no later than Friday before). Scan and upload your work and volunteer to present. 

	- Work on it: Friday–Monday
	- Submit by: Monday 1 pm on Canvas
	
2. **Wednesday Class Prep (1--2 hours)**: Work on the Class Prep assignment for the upcoming Wednesday class (posted no later than Monday). Scan and upload your work and volunteer to present. 

	- Work on it: Monday--Wednesday
	- Submit by: Wednesday 1 pm on Canvas
	
3. **Complete weekly homework and revisions (3 -- 4 hours)**. Work on homework problems throughout the week, and submit a revision of a previous homework problem.

	- Work on it: Throughout the week
	- Submit by: Friday 5 pm on Canvas

:::success
**A word about due dates**[^1]

Here is how due dates work in the workplace: They exist, and they’re important. However, there’s a certain amount of flexibility with them. If you need a little longer on something, you email whoever set the deadline and ask if you can have some more time. This is usually not a big deal, but if it happens a lot, people will start asking you if everything is alright.

That is also how due dates work in this class. Contact me to ask for an extension on anything you need, and that’s mostly fine. It helps if you propose a concrete new deadline (e.g. “I can get this to you by tomorrow at midnight…”). If you ask for lots of extensions, we’ll work together to find ways to help you keep up. Note that you may not get timely feedback if you need an extension on something.

If you have significant extenuating circumstances that cause you to miss multiple assignments, please come to an office hour to discuss broader accommodations. I’ll be flexible, but it helps to know what you need so that I can find the best way to help.

One important limit: Class Preps are due before class so that you’re primed and ready to think about others’ ideas, and so that I can choose presenters. For that reason, Class Preps absolutely must be done before class. If you need a little more time than the standard deadline let me know.
:::

## Learning activities and assessments

Most of this class will center around interesting and deep problems. You will first encounter a problem in *Class Prep*. Before class, you will spend time attempting to solve this problem. You and classmates will help us come to a common understanding of these questions through your *in-class presentations* and discussion. You will write up final solutions in *homework*, and may eventually revise and improve them. They will eventually become *portfolio problems* to showcase your progress. When you are especially proud of your work, you can submit it to the *class journal* too. Expect to spend a lot of time on each problem!

Twice this semester, I will ask you to reflect on your progress and compare it to the criteria for grades in our course. To do this, you will write a reflection about your work in the class, your understanding, and your goals for the rest of class. The goal is to ensure that we both agree on where you are, and what you need to do to succeed in class. Details will be given in class and posted on Canvas.

Each type of activity and assessment is described in more detail below. 

## How to earn a grade in this course

:::danger
Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please read this section carefully and ask questions as needed. 
:::

As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that *learning takes time* and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve *multiple attempts* that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe your work should be evaluated by just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you *clearly defined standards* for quality, *detailed feedback* on your work, and *opportunities to try again* based on the feedback. This gets you into a *feedback loop*, a conversation between you and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course students can *revise and resubmit some of their work*, several times over if needed, using the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.

:::success
The main goal for students in this course is to build a body of work, **a portfolio** of sorts, *that demonstrates understanding* of strategies and tactics in organic synthesis *as well as engagement* with the course. There are not exams to pass, points to earn, etc.
:::

### To earn an A

Consistently meet almost all of the criteria listed below, missing at most 2 or 3 items including **all boldface criteria**:

#### Ways to show understanding or organic chemistry

- **Write solutions to synthetic problems that meet objectives (after revision).**
- **Write several exemplary solutions throughout the semester and/or have several solutions accepted to the class journal.**
- **Demonstrate deep understanding of these topics: retrosynthetic analysis, chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity, green chemistry.**
- Draw mechanisms and use curved arrow electron-pushing formalism to explain reaction outcomes and selectivity.
- Find and use connections between ideas and concepts (in problems, presentations, research articles, and other places).
- Share your ideas by giving presentations or writing class journal entries that clearly communicate your thinking process.
- When presenting, give helpful answers to questions. When in audience, give presenters helpful feedback, ask questions.

#### Ways to show engagement with class

- **Complete assigned pre-class work with genuine good-faith effort. Work to make sense of new disconnections, reactions, and mechanisms (even if not fully correct). Try multiple approaches and include errors and comments on your thought process.**
- **Volunteer to present your work**
- **Volunteer to present a total synthesis case study**
- Actively participate in discussions (this could take many forms).
- Complete all work, in and out of class. Actively seek out resources to catch up if you miss class.
- Be a leader in your groups (there are different ways to demonstrate leadership).
- Support classmates and help them succeed.

### To earn a B

Frequently meet many of the criteria listed above (missing at most 4 of 5 items) **including all but one of the boldface ones**. Show meaningful progress on many of the criteria you don't fully meet. 

Instead of meeting each criterion consistently, you may meet them frequently: except for one or two instances, and/or you may argue that you’ve started to meet these consistently after not doing so at the start of the semester. 

### To earn a C

Either **meet a few of the criteria consistently** (4--5 total) including at least 2 boldface items *OR* **meet many (10--12) criteria but less often**. Show meaningful progress on a few more.

Do a few things very well and consistently, or do many things fairly well but less often. For example, you might show exemplary work on most problems, but complete few or no presentations. Or, you could meet objectives on several problems (with no exemplary work), present several times, and submit one proposal to the class journal.

## Class Prep and Research Notebook

**Description and Purpose**. I will post a list of the current problems on which we are working. Your goal is to read and solve---or make as much progress as possible---on these problems before the next class. This will ensure that you are ready to take an active part in our class presentations and discussions. The research notebook is a place to keep and organize your notes on reading material, research, and drafts of problems. 

In short, I’m asking you to attempt big, real, difficult problems before class. *This is not easy!* But, it’s also as real as chemistry gets. You will learn what to do when you don’t know what to do; how to find and try multiple approaches; the benefits of collaborating in order to generate new ideas and understand old ones; and how past mistakes can help you improve in the future.

**Research notebook**. You will need a way to keep handwritten notes organized. I suggest a 3-ring binder or folder that is dedicated to this class, or the electronic equivalent (e.g. a note-taking app on a tablet). Keep all of your Class Prep work together, dated and ordered, so that it’s easy to find.

### What to do

- Look up the reading and problems in Canvas. Read the text carefully, for full understanding. If there are new reactions or mechanisms, create examples to help you understand them. 
- For each problem

	- Start each problem on a new page in your research notebook. Label with the full problem or theorem number and statement, and the date.
	-  Work to solve the problem or propose the synthesis. This is a rough draft, aim to fully understand the ideas, but you can write in a unstructured format that identifies the key steps and ideas. Formal communication is not required, but aim to be thorough (don't make it harder for future self).
	-  Keep your mistakes! This process of understanding and attempting to solve new problems will involve many dead ends. Never erase your mistakes: Just put an “X” next to any idea which seems to be wrong, and write a note to yourself about why you believe it is wrong. These ideas will be useful in the future.

You are *strongly encouraged to collaborate on Class Prep*. Give specific credit next to ideas and key insights. See “Academic Integrity” for details. Class Prep work should take quite a while: Up to 50% of your out-of-class time should be devoted to working on these new problems. That is 1 - 2 full hours for each hour in class. Start at least 24 hours early. When done, scan and upload your Class Prep work to Canvas by 1 pm on class day. In the “Comments” text box, indicate which problems (if any) you would be willing to present in class. See Presentations and the Class Journal for details.

:::success
Think of Class Prep as a completion and effort assignment. Make a genuine effort to understand and thoroughly solve the required problems -- but it’s OK if this work is wrong! The goal is to be prepared. Incorrect but well-thought-out answers are fine. I may occasionally ask to see your research notebook, to ensure it is complete and organized.
:::

## Presentations and the Class Journal

A central part of this class is sharing your ideas with classmates. You can do this by presenting in class or publishing in our class journal. Presentations and class journals are great ways to show your engagement with chemistry ideas and engagement with class as a whole. Be willing to go out on a limb and share your thoughts!

### Present in class

I will ask you to present your work on some of the Class Prep questions during class. Your ideas will start discussions. Your goal is to have a complete and correct solution, but it is the goal that matters, not the actual solution.

- **Volunteeering to present:** When you submit your Class Prep work (see Class Prep), indicate which problems you are willing to present in class. I will post a list of presenters at the start of class. If you volunteered, be ready to present! I will not select presenters based on correctness, rather, I will focus on those whose voices have been heard less (or less recently). I may ask multiple students to present, if their solutions are different or illustrate interesting issues. You won’t present every time you volunteer.
- **Is it correct?** The goal of a presentation is to communicate your understanding of an idea in a helpful way, and to create discussions that help everyone understand it better. Aim to be correct, but the goal is the important part, not actually being correct. Mistakes and the discussions following them are some of the most valuable ways for everyone to learn!

### Publish in the Class Journal

The Class Journal is a document where we will collaboratively create professionally written solutions to every problem we do. I will post a list of all problems that are open for Class Journal submissions. Here's how you submit your work:

You may “claim” an open problem by emailing me. I will add your name and the date on the list of problems. You then have 1 week to submit an excellent homework-quality solution. You may only have one problem claimed at a time. Just like with presentations, if more than one person asks to claim a problem at the same time, I will choose based on who has completed fewer presentations and journals.

I will review your submission and choose whether to accept it. Journal problems must be fully correct and illustrate excellent communication. To achieve this, I might ask you to make revisions before accepting your work. 

## Homework

I will assign 1--3 homework problems every week. These are significant assignments that form the major part of your out-of-class work beyond class prep. Expect to spend at least half of your out-of-class time on homework. 

Write correct, complete, convincing, and clear solutions (synthetic proposals) to some Class Prep problems. This should be based on your own Class Prep work and our class presentations and discussion. You will also sometimes write short essays on related topics. Your work should meet the objectives listed in the assignment--each homework assignment will list some specific “focus” objectives. These will help you practice different aspects of communication throughout the semester. Homeworks must be typed in ChemDraw (templates will be available on Canvas).

Each homework set will have specific instructions about collaboration. You may always talk with me about problems. See “Academic Integrity” for more details. Homework is due each Friday at 5 pm on Canvas.

### Revisions of homework assignments

You may revise your work on one homework problem each week. 

**On each revision, include a short reflection:** Summarize the important items that caused you to earn a lower mark than desired. Then explain what you did to improve your understanding (be specific!), and how you have demonstrated that in this revision. With my permission, you may revise the same problem multiple times per week.

:::danger
**The reflection is essential.** This reflection is part of the revision: Without it, your revision is incomplete and won’t be reviewed. Avoid saying “it was just a small mistake” or “I made a bunch of silly mistakes.” If your progress didn’t meet the objectives, there was a major reason: What was it? In math, even “small” things can make a major difference in logic and correctness. 
:::
 
:::success
Revise a problem every week! I highly recommend talking with me to make sure you understand the comments before revising. If you’re aiming to create an exemplary professionally communicated solution, talk with me first: I usually don’t make comments about all of these aspects.
:::

## Portfolio

A portfolio is a carefully curated collection of work that tells a story. Your portfolio will tell the story of you as a scientist and student of organic synthesis from the first day of class to the last. Your goal is to convincingly argue that you have met the criteria for a certain grade. Your portfolio is due at the end of the final exam period, uploaded to Canvas.

==[Click here to read detailed Portfolio Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rP99au6EcbWO2yZg4yg4mAY3Ydq2tPFSfN_BkvuFTj8/view)==

### What should be in the portfolio?

I’ll post more specific instructions later in the semester. For now, you should know that the portfolio will include:

- Some short essays that give you a chance to showcase specific aspects of your work in class. These prompts will be posted later in the semester.
- A selection of solved synthesis problems that you submitted throughout the semester (for homework, check-in meetings, and class journals) that show how you have met various criteria.
- Other artifacts that show how you’ve met criteria for a grade. For example: If you gave a presentation that didn’t become a homework, but it helps show how you’ve met grade criteria, you can include it in the portfolio. Many other things are possible. In the end, anything that supports your argument for how you’ve earned a grade is fair game!
- Your grade: A guided reflection that describes which grade you are aiming to earn, and how your portfolio shows that you’ve met the criteria for that grade.

You can revise any work or other artifacts before including them in the portfolio. Your goal is to show how you’ve met the criteria for each grade by the end of the semester. If something confused you early on, but you’ve figured it out now, show me!

**Grades:** Your portfolio is, ultimately, your chance to show how you’ve met the criteria for a certain grade. Everything you include, and everything you write, should be aimed at that goal. I will read your artifacts and reflections carefully. If you make a convincing case, you’ll earn the grade that you are aiming for!

## Policies and disclaimers

### Attendance and participation

Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class sessions. During the Zoom calls, students are expected to engage and collaborate with peers on assigned tasks. Outside of the synchronous class time, students are expected to complete reading assignments to prepare for the class.

Excuses and exceptions will be interpreted by following university's [APM 232: Policy on Student Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf). 

### Late work/make-up policy

If you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to check on announcements made while you were away. The course attendance policy follows university’s [APM 232: Policy on Student Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf). Late assignments will not be accepted for a grade unless the absence meets the guidelines set forth by the univeristy policy [APM 232: Policy on Student Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf)

### Technology issues when submitting work

For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

### Academic Integrity and Collaboration[^2]

In this class, we will form a *research community*. Your primary goal in this course is to develop a deep personal understanding and expertise in organic chemistry. Collaboration and cooperation are extremely helpful in the learning process, and we will have many opportunities for collaborative work. However, there are some portions of our class that must be done independently.

This course is subject to the Fresno State course policies and the student code. This document establishes guidelines and expands and clarifies these policies with respect to all work done in CHEM 240T this semester. Be sure to read it carefully and honor it fully.

The student code defines academic misconduct as any action or behavior that misrepresents one’s contributions to or the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination. This includes cheating, collusion, dual submission, falsification, and plagiarism.

**Who can I collaborate with?** In CHEM 240T, collaboration is permitted and even encouraged in most circumstances. In particular, your team is a key resource for understanding new ideas. You may only collaborate with students currently enrolled in CHEM 240T.

**Acknowledging collaboration.** In all work, clearly state the name(s) of the person(s) you collaborated with on each problem. If you follow the instructions in this document, this will not harm your grade.

**Specific academic honesty expectations:** The following are guidelines for avoiding academic misconduct in assignments. The list is intended to be helpful but not exhaustive. If you are unsure about the appropriateness of some form of assistance on an assignment, you should always ask me.

- In general, you may work with your teammates on all assignments, as long as you acknowledge them and follow the requirements below (e.g. work only with team members at the same stage of solving the problem, don’t work together on independent problems).
- On every homework problem, every step of every solution must be one that you understand yourself and that you have generated by thinking about the problem. You are permitted to collaborate on big ideas and hints with classmates, including your team. However, you must always write solutions independently. All collaboration on homework exercises should occur when your collaborators are at essentially the same stage of the problem solution as yourself. For example, if you have not yet started problem #4 and you ask a friend (who has already completed it), “How did you do problem 4?”, this counts as academic misconduct. The resulting work is not and cannot be considered your own.
- Some homework problems will not allow collaboration. This helps to ensure that you can work independently to prove key results. In such cases, the only help allowed is consultation with me.
- On all work, unless directly stated otherwise, the only resources you may use are our course textbook and your class notes (including recordings). You are not permitted to go looking for completed solutions to problems in other texts or resources. In particular, use of Internet resources and other textbooks is completely off limits, including homework and class prep. Often, full solutions are posted online or in another book. If you see a solution, it is impossible for you to claim to have an original solution.
- Copying a solution, or any part of a solution, from any source (friend, Internet, book, etc.) in any setting, constitutes academic misconduct. 
- On any assignment, basing your work on the efforts of another student who previously completed this course, or one like it, is considered academic misconduct. Use of any shared or solicited materials, including those posted on Chegg or similar sites, is academic misconduct. Class materials may not be shared beyond other students in this class, including posting your solutions on Chegg or elsewhere.
- You may not seek the help of an instructor or tutor (other than me) unless you first discuss this with me in advance. If you do not verify that this is acceptable before seeking help, this will be considered academic misconduct. I am always willing to discuss any aspect of the course with you.

**Consequences of academic dishonesty.** Evidence of dishonest behavior on any assignment will result, at a minimum, in not being able to use that work as evidence in your grade check-ins and final portfolio. In severe cases, the minimum penalty will be failure of the course. Peers who willingly assist others in acts of academic misconduct are equally guilty, and will suffer similar penalties. In all cases, violations will be considered according to APM 235 [http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf](http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf).

:::info
**Remember that I want you to be successful.** That is, I want you to develop a deep, personal understanding of the material we study so that you become a better student of mathematics who can go on to do well in all of your future endeavors. Every part of this course structure – including both collaborative work and restrictions on collaboration – are intended to help you with this. You will often struggle, and that’s intentional – struggle (and eventual success!) is essential to learning. Indeed, productively failing (and learning from it) is part of your final grade.

In all aspects of the course, please understand that I am generous with hints and am always willing to discuss problems with you. I will never simply give you an answer, but I will offer direction and guidance that will assist you in coming up with a solution on your own. This is by far the most satisfying way to solve a problem, and the difficulty is well worth it.
I hope you will make frequent use of my office hours, email, and your team. You are always welcome to discuss your questions or concerns with me at any time.
:::

### Dropping the course after the census date

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.

Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

### Plagiarism Detection

The campus subscribes to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service, through Canvas. You will need to submit written assignments to Turnitin. Student work will be used for plagiarism detection and for no other purpose. The student may indicate in writing to the instructor that he/she refuses to participate in the plagiarism detection process, in which case the instructor can use other electronic means to verify the originality of their work. Turnitin Originality Reports WILL NOT be available for your viewing. 

### Dispute Resolution

If there are questions or concerns that you have about this course that you and I are not able to resolve, please feel free to contact the Chair of the department to discuss the matter. 

* Chair's name: Dr. Krish Krishnan
* Department name: Chemistry and Biochemistry
* Chair's email: krish@csufresno.edu
* Department phone number: 

### Intellectual Property

All course materials, including but not limited to the syllabus, readings, quiz questions, exam questions, and assignments prepared by the instructor are property of the instructor and University. Students are prohibited from posting course materials online (e.g., Course Hero) and from selling course materials to or being paid for providing materials to any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright violation. Audio and video recordings of class lectures are prohibited unless I give you explicit permission in advance. Students with an official letter from the Services for Students with Disabilities office may record the class if SSD has approved that service. Otherwise, recordings of lectures are included in the intellectual property notice described above.

### Student Ratings of Instruction

In the final weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete a short survey to provide feedback about this class. The primary goal of student ratings is to help your instructor improve the class. Feedback will also be reviewed by the department chair and the college dean. You will be given 15 minutes of class time to complete student ratings. Please offer feedback honestly and thoughtfully. Your participation is appreciated. You can access your student rating surveys and get more information at: https://sites.google.com/mail.fresnostate.edu/fresno-state-sri/fssri-for-students.

## COVID Policies

The following sections regarding COVID are subject to change given changing circumstances on-campus and in the community. Please check the COVID website for the most up-to-date information at [covid.fresnostate.edu](https://covid.fresnostate.edu)

### Vaccination

All Students who access Campus/Programs must be Fully Vaccinated (including the booster dose when eligible to receive it) in order to participate in any in-person course-related activities (either on-campus or off-campus). Students may select that they will not be participating in any in-person activities (which includes use of the Library, Student Union and/or Student Health & Counseling Center) and/or may attest to a Medical or Religious Exemption from the vaccine policy requirement in accordance with CSU and campus procedures. Students should go to the Student Portal to update their COVID self-certification form and vaccine documentation. Requests for exemptions can be found there. You are not to come to campus if any of the following are true:

* You are not considered fully vaccinated, and you have not attested to a medical or religious exemption.
* You have attested to an exemption, but you have not completed your mandatory weekly COVID-19 test. 

Health Screening: Please do not come to campus or off-campus learning site if any of the following is true: 

* If you have experienced COVID-19 symptoms (vaccinated or not). 
* If you have tested positive within the past 10 days.

Please complete the campus online reporting form (https://covid.fresnostate.edu/cases/reporting.html), and you will then receive further guidance.
Safety Measures:  While masks will no longer be required, we strongly encourage their use, as face coverings are still a valuable tool in the fight against COVID-19, especially in large group settings. We fully support and respect those who wish to continue wearing face coverings.
Individuals can pick up face coverings, provided at no cost, at any of the following locations: 

* Library
* University Student Union
* Student Health and Counseling Center
* Student Housing Atrium
* COVID Testing Site – check the below website for location
