# Week 5 Class Prep: Problem Set 5

Due: 2025-09-14 at 23:59.

**For each solution, regardless of correctness (or your confidence in its correctness), write down your thoughts, comments, thinking process.**

- Work on the problems in your research notebook and give each problem a good-faith effort to solve it.
- Provide commentary that gives the reader insight into the thinking process that went into solving the problem.
- It is okay if you get stuck and only have a portion of the problem. Try a different approach and describe what is holding you back.
- If you realize something is not working or reactions aren't compatible/appropriate - write it down.
- Help me (and your future self) navigate the pages, space things out and clearly mark what problem you're solving.

Scan your work into a single PDF file and upload here.

## Don't forget to volunteer to present!

Before submitting the assignment, indicate in the comments box that you want to volunteer. Write "I volunteer to present" and give a list of 3--5 problems you want to demonstrate at the board.
